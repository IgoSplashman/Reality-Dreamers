1.Cave Story ~ Doukutsu Monogatari
----------------------------------
Cave Story is a freeware sidescrolling action/adventure/platformer
title with leanings towards Wonderboy and recent sidescrolling
Castlevania titles. You control a little amnesiac who runs around
helping out these rabbit-ish creatures called Mimigas while trying
to find your way out of the giant cave inside the floating island
which makes up the game's setting.

You can expand your health meter by collecting Life Capsules in
similar fashion to Metroid games, while you can get stronger by
collecting energy to boost your firearms' output. Each weapon can
be built up to the maximum level (3) fairly quickly, but taking
damage will drain energy from its experience meter, sometimes
causing it to level down. Given how quickly they power up this
only tends to be an issue during boss fights, and even then there's
usually plenty of opportunities for collecting more weapon energy.

The game has loads of secrets, too. Shih Tzu and I haven't found
everything, and we've each played it through a couple of times
(not to mention having read the script.) It's pretty awesome that
way.

For a freeware Japanese platformer, it's fairly lengthy and has
quite a large amount of text. I'd guesstimate that each playthrough,
provided you knew what you were doing, would take about 4-6 hours.
Tack on an extra couple of hours if you don't know what you're
doing, possibly for extreme problems with nasty bosses (which this
game has plenty of, especially towards the end.) We're also talking
three very different endings, plenty of plot, and quite a cast of
charming characters. It really is a superb little gem :)

THE CAVE STORY TEAM
Main Team:
Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Hacker, Translation
Shih Tzu - Lead script translator

Special Thanks to...
--Shih Tzu, for facilitating contact with Pixel himself
--Pixel himself, for creating the game, allowing us to produce an
  English version of it, and for putting up with what must have
  seemed an awful amount of nagging questions on my part :) You've
  got the patience of a saint, and this wouldn't be done without
  you!
--sandcrab, who produced an alternate translation of the text for
  Pixel. It is, as yet, unpublished.
--Tomato & Bugcatcher, for helping out on a couple tough bits in
  the text. Cheers!

4.Known Issues
--------------
--The only known issue is that only Courier New is selectable from
  the font menu in the config util, but as the script has been
  formatted specifically with Courier New in mind, I don't consider
  this to be much of a problem.

Otherwise, there are no known issues. If you find any, please post
about them on The Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)

5.Application Instructions
--------------------------
First, download Doukutsu Monogatari and extract the contents of the
.lzh file to a directory. If you so desire, also download OrgView,
the standalone Doukutsu Monogatari music player and extract it to
the same directory. Both can be found at the following address:
(http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA022293/FreeSoft/Doukutsu.html)
(Be sure to take a look at the rest of Pixel's site, too, he's got
some nifty artwork floating around!)

Simply run the included "Cave Story Translation Installer.exe" file
on a clean Japanese installation of Doukutsu Monogatari 1.0.0.5 and
you should be all set to go!

If the music in the game is to your liking, the included "OrgView
Translation Installer.exe" will install English text into Pixel's
OrgView music player, which is available on the Doukutsu Monogatari
download page.

Afterwards, you're good to go!
